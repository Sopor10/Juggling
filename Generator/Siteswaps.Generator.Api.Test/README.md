# Siteswap Generator Tests

This testproject defines Tests for the expected behaviour of every implementation (if I ever find the time to write adapters to other existing implementations).

It uses Verify to verify the output from the generator.
To change the diff tool you can look at [Documentation](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.order.md).
In short:

This can be set in rider at:
