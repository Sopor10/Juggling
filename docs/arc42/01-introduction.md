# Introduction and Goals

## Purpose

The Juggling Siteswap System is a comprehensive tool for generating, analyzing, and visualizing juggling siteswap patterns. It enables jugglers to explore valid juggling sequences, understand their mathematical properties, and plan complex routines including passing patterns between multiple jugglers.

## Key Features

- **Pattern Generation**: Create valid siteswap patterns using customizable parameters (period, objects, throw heights)
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze orbits, states, transitions, and mathematical properties
- **Multi-Juggler Support**: Generate and analyze passing patterns for 2+ jugglers
- **Visualization**: Render causal diagrams, state graphs, and transition graphs
- **AI Integration**: MCP server provides LLM access to siteswap functionality
- **Web Interface**: Interactive browser-based generator with visual feedback

## Quality Goals

| Priority | Goal | Motivation |
|----------|------|------------|
| 1 | **Correctness** | All generated siteswaps must be mathematically valid |
| 2 | **Performance** | Generate patterns efficiently even with complex filters |
| 3 | **Usability** | Intuitive interface for both beginners and experts |
| 4 | **Extensibility** | Easy to add new filters, analysis features, and visualizations |
